# get_ping
#
# To "ping" a system is to see if it's up and running. This 
# function pings the bucket and the database server to make

#   M = # of items in the photoapp bucket
#   N = # of users in the photoapp.users table
#
# If an error occurs / a service is not accessible, M or N
# will be an error message. Hopefully the error messages will
# convey what is going on (e.g. no internet connection).

  Parameters
  ----------

  Returns
  -------
  a list of images that contain this label, even partial matches.
  Each element of the list is a tuple (assetid, label, confidence)
